# Terraform AWS SFTP Infrastructure Redpack

This Terraform project provisions an SFTP server over AWS Transfer Family, integrated with Amazon S3 and managed via a Route 53 Hosted Zone. It is designed with a modular approach for clarity, scalability, and reuse.

```

## 🧩 Modules Overview

Each module is self-contained and includes:
- `*_aws.tf`: Resource definitions for a specific AWS service.
- `variables.tf`: Module input variables.
- `outputs.tf`: Module outputs to be consumed by root or other modules.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Preview changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Deploy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
