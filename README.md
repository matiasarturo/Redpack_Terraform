## ðŸ§© Modules Overview

Each module is self-contained and includes:
- `*_aws.tf`: Resource definitions for a specific AWS service.
- `variables.tf`: Module input variables.
- `outputs.tf`: Module outputs to be consumed by root or other modules.

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Preview changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Deploy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
